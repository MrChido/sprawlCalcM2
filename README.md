A better sprawlopolis game calculator

12/21/2018 About a week ago, I recieved an email about a kickstarter post that the people who produce Sprawlopolis, Button Shy games, are soon going to implement their own(and definitely better looking) scoring guide/calculator. 

All the same, I never really expected this to get released into the public. THis has alwasy had the inteition of keeping me coding and to cement what information that i have gathered along the way. If someobody wants finds this and wants to use this i have no quarrels with that.

This is just a tool to keep the skills sharp in my mind.
